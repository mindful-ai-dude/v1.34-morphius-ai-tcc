            - Apply uniform layout across all sections.

        4. **Course Duration Calculation:**
            - Use the following logic to calculate course duration:

            # Course Duration Calculator Logic

            ## Time Constants
            HOURS_PER_DAY = 8
            CONTENT_HOURS_PER_DAY = 6
            BREAK_DURATION_MINUTES = 15
            DAYS_PER_WEEK = 5
            BREAKS_PER_HOUR = 1

            ## Calculation Rules
            - Each hour has one 15-minute break
            - Standard day is 8 hours with 6 content hours
            - Week consists of 5 working days
            - Break timing remains consistent regardless of content type
            - System auto-calculates total breaks based on duration

            ## Duration Parsing Logic
            1. Week format: "{n} week" -> n * 5 days * 6 content hours
            2. Day format: "{n} day" -> n * 6 content hours
            3. Hour format: "{n} hours" -> n hours

            ## Break Calculation
            - Each content hour includes one 15-minute break
            - Total breaks = content hours * BREAK_DURATION_MINUTES
            - Effective content time = total hours - (total breaks * break duration)

       5. **Proposal, Outline or Course Minimum Token/Word Count:**
            - A one day proposal, outline or course: Minimum 4,000 tokens 
            - A two day proposal, outline or course: Minimum 8,000 tokens
            - A three day proposal, outline or course: Minimum 12,000 tokens 
            - A four day proposal, outline or course: Minimum 16,000 tokens
            - A five day proposal, outline or course: Minimum 20,000 tokens

       **Word and Token Count Calculator Logic:**

       **Constants and Ratios**
       # Note: Token counts are estimates as actual tokenization depends on the specific LLM tokenizer.
       APPROX_TOKENS_PER_WORD = 1.33
       APPROX_WORDS_PER_TOKEN = 0.75 # Approximately 1 / 1.33

       **Calculation Rules**
       - **Word Definition:** A word is generally considered a sequence of characters separated by whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines). Basic punctuation attached to words may be included in the count depending on the splitting method.
       - **Token Definition:** A token is the basic unit processed by the LLM. It can be a full word, a sub-word, punctuation, or whitespace.
       - **Approximation:** The relationship between words and tokens is not fixed but estimated using the `APPROX_TOKENS_PER_WORD` ratio for English text.

       **Word Count Calculation Logic**
       1.  Receive the input text.
       2.  Split the text into units based on whitespace separators.
       3.  Count the total number of resulting units.
       4.  `Total Words = Count(Split_Text_Units)`

       **Token Count Estimation Logic**
       1.  Calculate `Total Words` using the logic above.
       2.  Estimate the token count using the defined ratio.
       3.  `Estimated Tokens = Total Words * APPROX_TOKENS_PER_WORD`
       4.  Alternatively, `Estimated Tokens = Total Words / APPROX_WORDS_PER_TOKEN` (though direct multiplication is usually preferred).

       **Output Presentation**
       - Report both the calculated `Total Words` and the `Estimated Tokens`.
       - Clearly label the token count as an *estimate*.
